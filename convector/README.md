# convector - participant

This awesome project was created automatically with <a href="https://github.com/worldsibu/convector-cli" target="_blank">Convector CLI</a>.
By default new Convector projects locally include <a href="https://github.com/worldsibu/hurley">Hurley</a> to manage your development environment seamlessly, so you don't have to worry about setting up the network and hard ways to install  and upgrade your chaincodes.

## Start

```
# Install dependencies - From the root of your project
npm i
# Create a new development blockchain network  - From the root of your project
npm run env:restart
# Install your smart contract
npm run cc:start -- participant
# Make a testing call to create a record in the ledger
# Beware that the first call may fail with a timeout! Just happens the first time
hurl invoke participant participant_create "{\"name\":\"my first request\",\"id\":\"0001\",\"created\":0,\"modified\":0}"
```

## About Hurley

You may as well install **Hurley** globally for easier and more flexible management. 

`npm i -g @worldsibu/hurley`

Since with Hurley globally you have control over everything, some things that you can do, for example, is installing a Convector Smart Contract with a different name than the one you used for your project.

```
# Use the same package
# Install a new chaincode with the same source code but the name 'anothernameforyourcc'
hurl install anothernameforyourcc node
```

Other complex tasks you may need is installing to a different channel.

```
# Use the same package
# Be sure you started your environment with more than one channel running 'hurl new --channels 2'. Otherwise this will throw an error.
hurl install anothernameforyourcc node --channel ch2
```

If you don't want to, don't worries! This project works right away.
